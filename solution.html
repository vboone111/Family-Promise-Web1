						<h1>Call to Action</h1>
						<p class="info">I have put together several examples of call to action buttons to reach out to my client's audience.</p>
					</header>
					<p> <b>Original:</b>
					<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/CTA_Buttons.png" alt="" /></span></div>
					My call to action consists of four main buttons as listed above. The commands will stay the same, but the type color and button color may change to any found within the style tile. I chose to utilize circles to tie the site in with the national foundation’s site, while at the same time providing the local organization its own identity. Removing the hard edges found on the current website gives the visitors a more welcoming and empathetic experience.<br><br>
					The “Learn More” button provides an easily accessible path for visitors to an overview of information on Family Promise of the Midlands. Upon clicking on this button the user is presented with a summary of who the organization is, what it does, how to get involved (volunteer/donate), and how one may seek help.<br><br>
					The “Volunteer Today” button will lead the user to a page complete with information about getting involved with Family Promise. This includes how to volunteer as an individual at the day center, as well as how a local church congregation can become a host site.<br><br>
					A critical component to Family Promise’s success is donations, monetary and goods. The “Donate Now” button provides clear access to instructions on how the community can assist the organization with their gifts.<br><br>
					“Get Help”...the main mission of Family Promise is to provide help to those in need. While the majority of those that Family Promise caters to do not have access to a computer, the site does still need to clearly provide instructions on how those in need can take advantage of the organization’s services. The “Get Help” button will lead to a page containing instructions on how a family can request help and also how a concerned person can seek help on behalf of someone else.
					</p>
					<p> <b>Revised:</b>
					<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/CTA_Buttons2.png" alt="" /></span></div>
					My call to action still consists of four main buttons as listed above. The “Donate” and “Volunteer” commands have been shortened to adhere to the readability of the button. The type color and button color may still change to any found within the style tile. In process critique, the circle buttons were not resonating to everyone as buttons you could click on. In order to address this issue, I have changed the shape of my buttons to a rounded rectangle. This change allows for the idea of soft edges to still apply as a more welcoming and empathetic experience.<br><br>
					The “Learn More” button description above does not change. However, this button may also be used on the homepage to direct your attention to other articles and news stories being featured.<br><br>
					The “Volunteer”, “Donate”, and “Get Help” button descriptions above do not change.<br><br>
					I have found that I may be able to use the circle element in another way on the website later in the process of prototyping. For example, the circle could call out a piece of information on an article page. I also thought about using the two  word commands (“Donate Now” or “Volunteer Today”) as a title of an article related to each one. The learning curve here is you may design one element a certain way with a really strong concept behind it. When you realize it doesn’t work, that doesn’t mean you have to trash the idea. By taking apart your element, you might just find new ways to incorporate it.

						<h1>Style Tile</h1>
						<p class="info">I have created this graphic to convey the general design and style elements as well as the feel of the website. A mock up of the homepage website for Family Promise of the Midlands is included.</p>
					</header>
					<p> <b>Original:</b>
					<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Style Tile RGB.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
					My style tile consists of a mock-up homepage, textures, colors, typography and pictures. The main goal for this style tile is to tie Family Promise of the Midlands to their National Family Promise brand and style. Using the resources I gained from my interview with Karen Newsome, I was able to get the brand standards of the National Family Promise Organization.<br><br>
					The mock up of the homepage starts with the Family Promise logo. I decided to change the current logo they are using to one that would better display their name. I took the information and insight from my employee interview to decide what my navigation bar would say for the different tabs. I included the “HOME” tab for those who might not be tech savvy and know you can click on the logo in the upper left corner to also return to the home page. The “NEWS” tab includes the success stories being shared of families that the organization has helped get back on their feet. This tab may also include any newsletters or articles about what is going on with Family Promise of the Midlands. “VOLUNTEER TODAY” is a call to action for the user. The tab “DONATE NOW” is also a call to action for community members, church congregations, and businesses to donate their facilities, resources, and money to help the organization. By saying “TODAY” and “NOW” on the ends of these actions gives the audience a little bit more enforcement to completing the task. The “GET HELP” tab is the tab where a user can find all the information they would need about applying for help or recommending someone else for help. The homepage call to action button is emphasized in the yellow circle and says, “LEARN MORE”. This call to action can apply to anyone and everyone. They would be learning more about the organization itself and what its goals are for the community. The idea with the background picture is for it to be a slide show (personal request by Karen Newsome).
					<br><br>
					The adjectives on the left side of the tile help the client understand the feel and tone of the updated website. These words were pulled directly from different sections of the brand standards. I incorporated the brand specific colors to help the words resonate more with the client. These colors are displayed in the circle swatches again referencing the call to action style element.<br><br>
					Typography was decided by the brand standards by the National Family Promise Organization. They have chosen Omnes in all weights and sizes. Minion Pro or Verdana are brand standard alternate typeface choices.<br><br>
					The pictures on the right side of the style tile showcase the different textures and context of Family Promise. I have included the children and family photographs to showcase the diversity Family Promise works with and helps. Single moms and dads with children are welcome to come to this organization as well as bigger families of 4 or more. The primary goal of Family Promise, and what sets them apart from other similar organizations, is to keep the family together.
					</p>
					<p> <b>Revised:</b>
					<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Style Tile 2 RGB.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
					This style tile encompasses the same message and feel as the original. The brand standards are still in effect as well as the content that is included.<br><br>
					To start with the mock up of the homepage, I changed “VOLUNTEER TODAY” to “VOLUNTEER” as well as “DONATE NOW” to “DONATE”. By doing this, my audience and users do not feel threatened or forced to complete the action. The navigation bar looks cleaner and has more room to breathe now. I also made “VOLUNTEER” the dark yellow from the color palette to call out this action specifically because it is the most important. I learned that Family Promise of the Midland’s main goal online is to reach out and post volunteer opportunities. They are always in need of volunteers. I also changed my sample header text on the picture to be an example of showcasing a recent news story. This provides better context for the call to action button below. The call to action “LEARN MORE” button shape has changed to a rounded rectangle. This resonates more with users as an actual button rather than the circle.<br><br>
					The only change that was made to the adjectives was a few color and treatment tweeks. This better relates the style to the meaning and expression of the word.<br><br>
					The typography is the same but I included it in the form of a post, allowing the client to see the relationship between the treatments, weights, and sections.<br><br>
					I adjusted the picture layout to include one from a very recent volunteer group since that is the main audience for the website.
