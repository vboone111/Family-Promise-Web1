						<h1>Secondary Research</h1>
						<p class="info">I researched of other organizations that deal with homelessness in their communities and found what works well conceptionally and visually for their websites.</p>
					</header>
					<p> <b> ECHO <a href="#">https://echomeless.org</a> </b> <br>
						<ul>
								 <li>ECHO stands for Eastern Carolina Homelessness Organization. Their mission statement is “to break the cycles of homelessness experienced by individuals and families in our community”. Their main facilities are in Myrtle Beach, SC but they also have a location of Florence, SC.</li>
								 <li>Their home page of their website is clean and has the important tabs of information at the top for a smaller navigation bar. They also use the hamburger menu when the screen size decreases. The thing I think is most effective for their website is the transitional picture buttons right in the center full of contrast to catch the viewer’s eye. These buttons take the viewer to the most important and most common pieces of information a viewer might want to know.</li>
						</ul>

					<p> <b> The Salvation Army <a href="#">https://www.salvationarmycarolinas.org</a> </b> <br>
						<ul>
								 <li>The Salvation Army works in both North and South Carolina to end homelessness.  Their mission statement is “The Salvation Army, an international movement, is an evangelical part of the universal Christian Church. Its message is based on the Bible. Its ministry is motivated by the love of God. Its mission is to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ and to meet human needs in His name without discrimination”.</li>
								 <li>They have their website built to a similar degree with ECHO. Locations and Donate are their most popular reason for viewers to go to their website so they are separate from the main navigation bar as well as located there too. They have news articles as their primary imagery on the home page as well as social media buttons in the middle.  The Salvation Army has a wide range of ages that might need to use the website, so it’s good for them to have several different set ups for links of the same page in case the viewer missed the first option to click on. Many of their linked pages to their website have trails for the viewer to follow to specifically tailor to what they are looking for.</li>

					<p> <b> Family Promise <a href="#">https://familypromise.org</a> </b> <br>
						<ul>
								<li>Family Promise was first created in 1986. By 1988 the Network of this organization becomes National. Their mission statement is “to help families experiencing homelssness and low-income families achieve sustainable independence through a community-based response”. This is the National website and probably the most important to look at  for the purposes of this project. My client is a branch of Family Promise located in the Midlands of South Carolina. To improve my client’s website, the main focus of researching further into the main website is to see how they effectively use design to guide their viewers. Implementing some of these characteristics would be key in linking the two branches of Family Promise together.</li>
								<li>Their main colors are yellow, blue, and purple.  Purple and blue are used for the main stories and yellow is used as a “call out” color.  As the viewer scrolls down the home page, they use space well and provide  roll-over buttons with clear written text to lead the way for the viewer. A unique aspect is that they provide a scrollable screenshot of their current facebook page for viewers to have a sneak peak.  They have their major stats on the page as well as their most recent story or article. Their navigation bar is located across the top of the page and provides drop down menus of more links. They effectively use typefaces and hierarchy.</li>
