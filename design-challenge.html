            <b> 1. What is the problem you are trying to solve? </b> Homelessness (specifically families) in the Midlands of South Carolina. <br>
            <b> 2. Frame it as a design question. </b> How does Family Promise’s website help lower the number of homeless families on the streets in the Midlands of South Carolina?<br>
            <b> 3. Now, state the ultimate impact you’re trying to have.</b> To create an easy and clean website to navigate for those who are looking to volunteer or sign up for the program. Ultimately to help bring in more help so this organization can complete their mission.<br>
            <b> 4. What are some possible solutions to your problem?</b> Hierarchy throughout images and typefaces, cohesive organization between the different pages, fix transitions and broken links, clearer mission statement on home page, make home page more approachable, and enhance the overall site to appear less dated and more professional<br>
            <b> 5. Finally, write down some of the context and constraints that you’re facing.</b> Only focusing on the Midlands of SC branch, privacy rights with participants, only 2 full time employees work in the organization, and will the site specific to the Midlands organization need to adhere to the national organization’s guidelines (it currently does not do this)<br>
            <b> 6. Does your original question need a tweak? Try it again.</b> How do I create a more approachable, organized website for volunteers and families in need to be able to easily find the information they require regarding Family Promise of the Midlands of South Carolina, thus helping the organization achieve its goal of reducing the number of homeless families in the community?
