This may include, monetary donations, but more importantly volunteering individually or as a group such as being a host congregation.</p>
					<p>Website visitors will be looking for information on how to volunteer their time, how to donate money or items, or they may be seeking help themselves.</p>
					<p>The priorities of the website are to provide information for people wanting to volunteer their time or make a donation, share success stories of the organizations “graduates” and present clear instructions on how to receive help.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Local Congregations and Businesses are the first priority because they would need to find the information on recommending a family and becoming a host congregation.</li>
						<li>Community Members are the second priority because they would need to find information on how and when they could volunteer.</li>
						<li>Homeless Families are the last priority because most are not going to seek help through a website initially. Most also do not have a computer of their own to access the website.</li>
